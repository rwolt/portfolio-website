summary: " Restaurant Online Ordering App was built as a team project with one other developer. The concept for the app is that it includes both a customer-facing online ordering process as well as a dashboard for the restaurant staff to manage the status of orders and make changes to the menu.  "

**Project Purpose and Goal:** The goal of this project was to build a functional full stack application using a modern tech stack that is type safe. Typescript was used to ensure type safety at compile time, and zod was used to validate user input on the Express server. Form inputs were validated on the front end using react-hook-forms, and zustand was used for managing the state of the cart. On the server, Prisma was used as an ORM to communicate with a PostgreSQL database. I primarily worked as the front end developer on this project, but also built out several API endpoints. 

**Web Stack and Explanation:** The technologies used on this project were chosen in order to learn more about building fully type safe applications using Next.js and Prisma. Tailwind was chosen as a CSS framework for faster prototyping and because it was a comfortable choice for the team. Because this was a reasonably large project, we looked for a nicer way to manage state that would scale well as we added components. react-hook-forms was used for managing form state and validation, as well as zustand for managing state within React components. 

**Problems and Thought Process:** We encountered several difficulties with this project, mostly related to learning too many new libraries in a single project and spending too much time on non-core functionality of the app. While this slowed the pace of development, me and my teammate both held each other to a high standard of making the code readable and well organized, and regularly conducted code reviews on each others code. The most important thing we did that helped manage the projectâ€™s complexity, was to  agree upon a workflow that used Kanban and git to track features as they moved through the development lifecycle. This helped us to prioritize features and stay organized as the project grew in complexity. 

**Lessons Learned:**  As the first large full stack project I have worked on, I learned many things. Most importantly, I gained experience using Typescript with React, using feature branches and creating pull requests in git, using Kanban to track development tasks. Using the MVC pattern to design our API taught me the value in using standard design patterns to better organize code and make it easier to refactor. This project also taught me that I can learn new libraries in a relatively short amount of time. While there is a tradeoff between learning a new library and using what you already know, in the future I will be less hesitant to jump into a new framework or library because I trust my ability to read the docs and gain enough understanding to build out a particular feature.
